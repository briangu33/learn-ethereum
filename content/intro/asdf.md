# Introduction

This is a compilation of resources on blockchain, organized roughly by topic and focused primarily around Ethereum. Each sub-list contains some combination of readings, tutorials, and/or my own notes.

Here is my thesis: the signal-to-noise ratio of a simple Google search for any given blockchain topic is extremely low, especially for a newcomer who doesn’t even know what to query to begin with. Prominent information online is poorly-written (Bitcoin Whitepaper) or sometimes just inaccurate (John McAfee’s tweets). This is my attempt to carve out a space of quality-assured resources for anyone looking for an entry point into blockchain. 

More specifically, this site is meant for anyone with a technical background who is interested in blockchain, but has little-to-no prior exposure. Though I personally am positive on blockchain presently, this document is not meant to be an endorsement of the usefulness of blockchain technology; in fact, it’s probably best if you come in with a fairly neutral or even skeptical attitude. Basic familiarity with cryptographic primitives, markets/economic incentives, and software engineering/design principles may be particularly helpful, depending on what topics you are interested in.

I strongly recommend that you start with “Ethereum 101.” From there, feel free to peruse the resources in any order: go through individual topics, skip around, whatever. As time goes on, if there is interest, we might experiment with adding more structure (discussion groups, office hours, etc.).

All of my documents, including this one, are by default in a WIP state (I will try to annotate this accordingly). Note that so-called “cryptocurrency investing” is completely out of the scope of this document collection.
