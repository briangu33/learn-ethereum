<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>This is a collection of tutorials and articles on blockchain, organized roughly by topic and focused primarily around Ethereum.</p>

<p>Here is my thesis: the signal-to-noise ratio of a simple Google search for any given blockchain topic is extremely low, especially for a newcomer who doesn’t even know what to query to begin with. Prominent information online is poorly-written (Bitcoin Whitepaper) or sometimes just inaccurate (John McAfee’s tweets). This is my attempt to carve out a space of quality-assured resources for anyone looking for an entry point into blockchain.</p>

<p>More specifically, this site is meant for anyone with a technical background who is interested in blockchain, but has little-to-no prior exposure. Though I personally am positive on blockchain presently, this resource collection is not meant to be an endorsement of the usefulness of blockchain technology; in fact, it’s probably best if you come in with a fairly neutral or even skeptical attitude. Basic familiarity with cryptographic primitives, markets/economic incentives, and software engineering/design principles may be particularly helpful, depending on what topics you are interested in.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend that you start with “Ethereum 101.” For a total newcomer, reading the documents in order will make the most sense.</p>

<p>Note that so-called “cryptocurrency investing” is completely out of the scope of this document collection.</p>
