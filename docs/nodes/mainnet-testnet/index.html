<p>Ethereum is a protocol; there can be multiple independent networks conforming to this protocol that do not interact with each other.</p>

<p>The main Ethereum network (<em>mainnet</em>) is one such network. However, other important networks exist besides the mainnet. Most of these are <em>testnets</em>, which are networks used by protocol developers or smart contract developers to test both protocol upgrades as well as potential smart contracts in a production-like environment before deployment to mainnet. Think of this as an analog to production versus testing servers. It’s generally important to test any contract code you write on a testnet before deploying to the mainnet.</p>

<p>Ether on testnets has no real value; therefore, there are no markets for testnet Ether. Since you need ether to actually interact with Ethereum, most people get testmet ether from <em>faucets</em>. Most faucets are webapps where you can input an address which you request ether to be sent to. You can usually find testnet faucets by Googling.</p>

<p>There are multiple Ethereum testnets. <strong>Ropsten</strong> is a testnet which uses “Proof-of-Work” as its consensus algorithm, a transaction validation process equivalent to that of the mainnet; it is supported by both Geth and Parity. <strong>Rinkeby</strong> is a testnet which uses a different “Proof-of-Authority” consensus algorithm. There are several more beyond these.</p>
